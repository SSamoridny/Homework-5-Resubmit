# Homework-5-Resubmit
I had major issues with this file. I had submitted it on September 26th and over the weekend had some computer issues which then deleted some files. As I made a few last minute changes I had error messages in my terminal and as I checked my link it was no longer working properly. I was able to redo the files but I ended up deleting the old repository and then doing a one time push to update the files which is why you will see the one push. Looking back I probably shouldn't have panicked and done that but I was worried about waiting until Monday. 

This is the Homework 5 dayplanner which has the functionality that was asked of it. 

Thank you,
Shaun Samoridny
