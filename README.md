Workday Planner

https://ssamoridny.github.io/Workday-Planner/

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

In this project we used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to build a week day planner that scrolls through the hours of your workday and highlights upcoming, past and future appointments. Using local storage we were able to keep appointments in your planner through refreshing of the borwser and also gave the ability to delete these items when you were ready to move to a new day. The second part of the project involved having the hours colour coded to show current, past and present time in an effort to alert you to where you stood in your workday.
